# Poklang
Poklang is a lightweight imperative programming language. It revolves around variable manipulation and commands. There are 31 commands in Poklang, and these commands allow you to do basic mathematical operations, string manipulation, I/O and boolean logic. Poklang is able to do most simple tasks that only require access to the console.
# Setting Up Interpreter
There are 4 python files - "main.py", "LexerModule.py", "ParserModule.py" and "ExecutorModule.py". They work together to interpret and run text as code. In "main.py", there is a variable called "fileName" on line 1. It should be set to the name of the Poklang file you are running. By default, it is set to "main.txt". The Poklang file does not have to be a .txt or plaintext file.<br><br>NOTE: A quick and simple way to set up the interpreter is to copy the python scripts into a Replit project. The entire interpreter was scripted using Replit's IDE.
