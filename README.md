# Setting Up Interpreter
There are 4 python files and 1 text life - "main.py", "LexerModule.py", "ParserModule.py", "ExecutorModule.py", "Poklang.txt". They work together to interpret and run text as code. If you want to change the name of the Poklang file, you need to change the value of "fileName" in line 1 of "main.py". By default, it is set to "Poklang.txt".<br><br>An alternative to running the 4 python files is running "PoklangInterpreter.py", which is all 4 files joined together as one.
