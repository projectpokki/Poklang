# Poklang
Poklang is a lightweight, dynamic, imperative, unstructured programming language. Poklang is able to do basic math operations, string manipulation, console IO and boolean operations. I finished making this on February 2, 2024.

There is an interpreter for Poklang in the ```Poklang``` folder. 4 python files, ```main.py```, ```LexerModule.py```, ```ParserModule.py``` and ```ExecutorModule.py```, work together to interpret Poklang code. ```PoklangInterpreter.py``` is all 4 python files joined together as one. The file that is run is ```Poklang.txt```.

Poklang has many problems and limitations. Its interpreter is also buggy. This is more of a prototype for Poklang++ than a practical programming language.

# Poklang++
Poklang++ is a lightweight, static, imperative, structured programming language. It is an improved version of Poklang. Poklang++ is able to do advanced math operations, string and array manipulation, console and file IO, boolean and bitwise operations, ASCII-number conversion, and do time related tasks. I finished making this on July 16, 2024.

The interpreter for Poklang++ is in the ```Poklang++``` folder. ```Pkl-Interpreter.py``` will ask for a file to interpret when it is run the first time. There are also examples of Poklang++ code in the folder.
